Ever asked yourself, 
"where did I put that orbital bombardment?"
"How many chunks are left on the map?" 
"I wonder how many shirts the colony has left?"
"Who took the masterwork Thrumbo pants?"

With the Inventory tab mod, you will never misplace, miss or lose an item ever again!

Features:
	View every item in the stockpiles!
	Options to search the whole map, colonist, animal, prisoners and even the dead!
	Has a handy search bar!
        Japanese Translation (Thanks to Proxyer)
        [strike]German Translation (Thanks to Amalek): https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2107444087[/strike] Now included in the mod.

Version 2.0: Now with saving options! (and minor bug fixes)

Version 1.5 : Now with options menu!

Disclamier: 1.0 version of this mod is broken but usable I'm trying to see if I can fix it in the coming days but no guarantees.

WARNING! The mod has a slight impact on fps when the tab is opened and you have a high number of items, it gets worse the farther you zoom out and speed up time.
